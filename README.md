# A convex polyhedron without Rupert’s property

This repository is accompanying the paper [A convex polyhedron without Rupert’s property](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13754) by J. Steininger and S. Yurkevich:

_A three-dimensional convex body is said to have Rupert's property if its copy can be passed through a straight hole inside that body. In this work we construct a polyhedron which provably is not Rupert, thus we disprove a conjecture from 2017._
